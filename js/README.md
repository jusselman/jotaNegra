## Technologies Uses:

HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Getting Started:

>> The **objective** is to reach the highest amount of card value less than or equal to 21.
A hand that goes about twenty one forfeits the game. The game begins with a Javascript 
constructor generating a deck which is then randomized. Next, the cards are taken from 
deck one at a time and used for gameplay.


## Next Steps:

1. Add a betting feature to make the game more competitive. 

2. Create a scoring element totaling the points gained from each hand. 

3. Enhance graphics by implementing a smoother transition to cards appearing.

4. Refactor code to simplify the functions. 

5. Implement an animation upon winning.
